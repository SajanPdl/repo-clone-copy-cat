# Subscription System and Admin Panel Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Panel - Failed to Fetch Users
**Problem**: The admin panel was showing "Failed to fetch users" error because it was trying to use an edge function that wasn't working properly.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/components/admin/UsersManagement.tsx` to use the `public.users` table directly instead of the edge function
- The component now fetches users from the `users` table which is properly set up with RLS policies
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Added a refresh button for manual data refresh

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/admin/UsersManagement.tsx`

### 2. Subscription Workflow Integration
**Problem**: Users clicking "Upgrade to Pro" or upgrade buttons weren't being redirected to the subscription workflow.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/components/PremiumSubscription.tsx` to redirect to `/subscription` page instead of handling payment directly
- The component now uses `useNavigate` from React Router to redirect users to the subscription workflow
- Removed the complex payment dialog and simplified the upgrade flow

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/PremiumSubscription.tsx`

### 3. Edge Function Issues
**Problem**: The `get-users` edge function was returning 500 errors due to incorrect imports and configuration.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the Supabase import in the edge function
- Added proper CORS handling
- Added better error handling and logging
- However, the admin panel now uses direct database queries instead of the edge function

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/functions/get-users/index.ts`

## How the Subscription Flow Works Now

1. **User clicks upgrade button** (in PastPapersPage, PremiumPage, or any other component)
2. **Redirects to `/subscription`** page
3. **Shows SubscriptionWorkflow component** with:
   - Available subscription plans
   - Payment request form
   - Upload receipt functionality
   - Payment status tracking

## Admin Panel Features

The admin panel now properly shows:
- Total users count
- Admin users count  
- Regular users count
- User management with role updates
- Search and filter functionality
- User details dialog

## Database Structure

The system uses:
- `public.users` table for user management
- `subscription_plans` table for available plans
- `payment_requests` table for payment tracking
- `user_subscriptions` table for active subscriptions

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Admin Panel**: Navigate to `/admin` and check the Users section
2. **Subscription Flow**: Click any upgrade button and verify it redirects to `/subscription`
3. **User Management**: Try updating user roles in the admin panel

## Notes

- The edge function is still deployed but not used by the admin panel
- All upgrade prompts now redirect to the subscription workflow
- The subscription workflow handles payment verification and subscription creation
- Admin users can manage all users and their roles through the admin panel
